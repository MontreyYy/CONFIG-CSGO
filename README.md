Resolution: 800x600 streched (lets you see heads better and gives you an advantage of reacting faster)

Global Shadow Quality: high (lets you see shadows heavly better cause shadow edges get sharpened, so you can react faster to it)

Model-Texture Details: low (gives you more fps and no one cares about textures on a model)

Effect Details: low (lets you seperate people better from smokes and firenades, increases ur fps)

Shader-Details: low (lets you seperate people better from smokes and firenades, increases ur fps)

Multicore-Rendering: Enable (gives you more FPS)

Multisampling Anti-Aliasing Mode: 4MXAA (gives a small smothing on endges but lets you still see people behind headshot boxes as a square. This is because of to small details (u only can see 1 or 2 pixels of a model) get pixeled out.)

FXAA Anti-Aliasing: Disable (FXAA is searching for sharp edges like cables, wall corners or simular things and smoothes them out by using a blure matrix. The blur is just 0.1% but strong enough to make it even harder to recognize people moving or behind headshot boxes)

Texture Filter Mode: Bilinear (smoothes out textures, this allows you to seperate people better from wired backgrounds like brickwalls on cobblestone)

VSYNC: Disable (not needed)

Motion Blur: Disable (useless smothing on movement)
