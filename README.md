<b>Resolution:</b> 800x600 streched (lets you see heads better and gives you an advantage of reacting faster)<br>

<b>Global Shadow Quality:</b> high (lets you see shadows heavly better cause shadow edges get sharpened, so you can react faster to it)<br>

<b>Model-Texture Details:</b> low (gives you more fps and no one cares about textures on a model)<br>

<b>Effect Details:</b> low (lets you seperate people better from smokes and firenades, increases ur fps)<br>

<b>Shader-Details:</b> low (lets you seperate people better from smokes and firenades, increases ur fps)<br>

<b>Multicore-Rendering:</b> Enable (gives you more FPS)<br>

<b>Multisampling Anti-Aliasing Mode:</b> 4MXAA (gives a small smothing on endges but lets you still see people behind headshot boxes as a square. This is because of to small details (u only can see 1 or 2 pixels of a model) get pixeled out.)<br>

<b>FXAA Anti-Aliasing:</b> Disable (FXAA is searching for sharp edges like cables, wall corners or simular things and smoothes them out by using a blure matrix. The blur is just 0.1% but strong enough to make it even harder to recognize people moving or behind headshot boxes)<br>

<b>Texture Filter Mode:</b> Bilinear (smoothes out textures, this allows you to seperate people better from wired backgrounds like brickwalls on cobblestone)<br>

<b>VSYNC:</b> Disable (not needed)<br>

<b>Motion Blur:</b> Disable (useless smothing on movement)<br>
