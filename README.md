Resolution: 800x600 streched (lets you see heads better and gives you an advantage of reacting faster)<br>

Global Shadow Quality: high (lets you see shadows heavly better cause shadow edges get sharpened, so you can react faster to it)<br>

Model-Texture Details: low (gives you more fps and no one cares about textures on a model)<br>

Effect Details: low (lets you seperate people better from smokes and firenades, increases ur fps)<br>

Shader-Details: low (lets you seperate people better from smokes and firenades, increases ur fps)<br>

Multicore-Rendering: Enable (gives you more FPS)<br>

Multisampling Anti-Aliasing Mode: 4MXAA (gives a small smothing on endges but lets you still see people behind headshot boxes as a square. This is because of to small details (u only can see 1 or 2 pixels of a model) get pixeled out.)<br>

FXAA Anti-Aliasing: Disable (FXAA is searching for sharp edges like cables, wall corners or simular things and smoothes them out by using a blure matrix. The blur is just 0.1% but strong enough to make it even harder to recognize people moving or behind headshot boxes)<br>

Texture Filter Mode: Bilinear (smoothes out textures, this allows you to seperate people better from wired backgrounds like brickwalls on cobblestone)<br>

VSYNC: Disable (not needed)<br>

Motion Blur: Disable (useless smothing on movement)<br>
